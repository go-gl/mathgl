// multiplications Each push to a TransformStack multiplies the current top of
// the stack with thew new matrix and appends it to the top. Each pop undoes the
// previous multiplication.
//
// This allows arbitrary unwinding of transformations, at the cost of a lot of
// memory. A notable feature is the reseed and rebase, which allow invertible
// transformations to be rewritten as if a different transform had been made in
// the middle.
